# CircleOnCircles, a Utopia Architect.

> "I am willing to give all my data to a transparent algorithm. In return, could the algorithm help me finish my todolist?"

I am building an utopia from my own company, Codustry. We are digital-nomad worker-owned tech company based in Thailand and Singapore.
Don't trust my words, please take a look at my karma. I created enough footprint in this digital world.
